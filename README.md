# Hand-gestured-control-car
The idea is to implement a glove that can be worn by the user in his hand in order to control the vehicle. User can control the car direction whether right or left just by tilting his hand in free space. The device also haves 3 speed motor, user can speed up by bending his finger and he can go backward by bending 2 fingers. The device is completely wireless thus no wired connection to the car will take place.

The glove includes Accelerometer which detect X Y Z direction , flex sensor which is responsible for the multiple speed of the car and last the LCD screen which show the recent direction on it.
Xbee module is used to link between the glove and the car.


Components used :
2X Arduino Uno 
1X Accelerometer  [ i used that MMA 8452 ]
2X Flex Sensor 
1X H-bridge 
2X X-bee module 
1X LCD screen
